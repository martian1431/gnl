I been calling tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)
Feeling lost and I don't know what to do
So can you can you get back to me?
So can you can you get back to me?
So can you can you get back to me?

I'm calling God, leaving voicemails
I know your there, I need to talk before my voice fails
Before your boy bails
'Cause they be taking all the fun away
I'm listening to Say Goodbye to Hollywood and run away
I guess be careful what you wish for, right?
You say the truth and they come at you with pitch forks, right?
I'm in Copenhagen, overthinking
Every single moment, pacing
'Round and 'round the room
Its 4:00 AM, I'm at the phone just waiting
For your call, I need a pep talk, God
It's getting harder to keep going, I need a rest stop, God
I swear none of these massages get the stress off, God
Sometimes I swear I want to get a gun and let off, God
Aim it right at my enemies
Make the devil obey me
They tryna kill me
Can you blame me for the thoughts I have lately?
I know it sounds crazy
That's why I call daily
Please don't betray me
God can you save me? (Pick up)

I been calling tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)
Feeling lost and I don't know what to do
So can you can you get back to me?
So can you can you get back to me?
So can you can you get back to me?

Family issues make success bitter sweet
Sometimes a cold shoulder is the only way to deliver heat
Thats the situation that I'm in with my dad
Me and my mom dip quick
No one lives with my dad
Yeah it's sad but he brought it on himself
Last time we talked, we didn't talk, we just yelled
He knows he got issues, he told me he's getting help
Told dad I got to put the relationship on the shelf
Deal with what I've dealt
Welp, boohoo right?
I shouldn't care 'cause I got houses and some new coupes, right?
But money's not an adhesive that can take all the pieces 
Of a broken family and put them back together
Arenas ain't as loud as inner turmoil
Get to the roots, replace any burnt soil
While the world boils over fake problems with me
I just need sixty, seconds
Yo god, hit me (please record your message)

I been calling tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)
Feeling lost and I don't know what to do
So can you can you get back to me?
So can you can you get back to me?
So can you can you get back to me?

Fuck
I guess I'ma just keep calling
One of these days you gonna pick up, hopefully
Yeah
